        This is a demo for showing how you can implement <a href="https://nopassword.alexsmolen.com/">NoPassword</a> authentication
        in your Nancy applications.
    </p>
    <p>
        The demo uses the <a href="https://github.com/NancyFx/Nancy/wiki/Forms-authentication">Nancy.Authentication.Forms</a> package to 
        perform authentication, but instead of directly logging the user in, it uses the <a href="http://nuget.org/packages/fluent-email">Fluent Email</a> 
        Nuget to send the user an e-mail with the login token.
    </p>
    <p>
        When the user clicks the link it will be taken to the site which will verify the token and log the user in. A cookie will be
        generated which is then used to re-authenticate the user when visiting the site. As soon as the user logs out, the token will
        be revoked (and the cookie removed) an can no longer be used.
    </p>
    <p>
        In order to run this demo locally, on your machine, you need to make sure the mail settings, in web.config, are properly
        configured. You can save the e-mails to your hard drive by using the following settings
    </p>
    <pre><code class="xml">&lt;smtp deliveryMethod="SpecifiedPickupDirectory"&gt;
    &lt;specifiedPickupDirectory pickupDirectoryLocation="C:\TestMailMessages\" / &gt;
&lt;/smtp&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
    Or you can use a fake SMTP service, like <a href="http://papercut.codeplex.com">Papercut</a>, to send the e-mails to a local SMTP
    server that will enable you to view the e-mail content using a GUI.
</p>
    <pre><code class="xml">&lt;smtp deliveryMethod="Network"&gt;
  &lt;network host="localhost" port="25" defaultCredentials="true" /&gt;
&lt;/smtp&gt;</code></pre>
